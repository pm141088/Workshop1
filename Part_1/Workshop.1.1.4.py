# Workshop 1 - Part 1 - Step 3

# Next navigate the following file: Link
# This has goto statements like the following: goto 27
# This means go to line 27 in the file and read the statement there. Please note that calc and goto statements can be combined like so: goto calc / 27 9
# This is equivalent to goto 3.
# For simplicity assume that we cannot nest calc statements, decimals are rounded down and out of bounds gotos (i.e. invalid line numbers) do not occur.

# Starting from line 1, use the rules above to navigate the document, stopping when you've hit a statement youâ€™ve seen once before (they are allowed to be from different lines!).
# When finished please send the statement and line number the code has stopped on to a tutor.
